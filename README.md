# API Load Testing Time

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

• Here, you can test the total time taken by the API to get a response from the server.

• Please use only those APIs whose responses are in JSON format.

• If you put the **cURL** command in the cURL box, it should follow the format typically generated by Postman. Ensure the cURL command is compatible because not all cURL formats or types may be supported.
